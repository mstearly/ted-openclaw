Replace raw policy markdown viewing with dedicated operator pages that provide structured controls, impact preview, and approval logging.

## Non-negotiables

## Deliverables

- Policy center routes for Job Board, Promotion Policy, Value/Friction Gates.
- Structured form controls + preview panel.
- Save path with approval metadata.

## Friction KPI Evidence

- policy edit completion time
- policy save error rate
- policy changes with preview rate
