# JC-047 - Operator Flow and Approval Path Clarity

## Outcome

From Clint’s seat, Ted clearly states where approvals happen and how work flows across Ted and OpenClaw surfaces.

## Promotion State

- Current: DONE
- Promotion rule:
  - Operator flow panel must render with primary/secondary surfaces and notes.

## Non-negotiables

- Approval path is explicit and consistent.
- No hidden operational control paths.

## Deliverables

- Operator workflow panel in Ted UI.
- Plain-language notes for approval and draft review surfaces.

## Friction KPI Evidence

- approval routing confusion incidents/week
- median time to find correct approval surface
- wrong-surface actions per day

## Proof Evidence (Executed)

- `scripts/ted-profile/proof_jc047.sh`
