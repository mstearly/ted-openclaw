# JC-031 — UI Surface Inventory and Gap Map

## Outcome

Ted UI has a canonical, versioned inventory of all surfaces/actions/states with explicit gaps before any redesign work proceeds.

## Promotion State

- Current: DONE
- Promotion rule:
  - Requires council review sign-off on inventory completeness.

## Non-negotiables

- Inventory must map each surface to JTBD and governance requirement.
- Gaps must be explicit and prioritized.

## Deliverables

- `22_TED_UI_SURFACE_INVENTORY.md`
- accepted gap map and severity ranking

## Proof Script

- `scripts/ted-profile/proof_jc031.sh`

## Friction KPI Evidence

- connector success rate
- ingestion lag
- classification accuracy
- retry/backoff rate
