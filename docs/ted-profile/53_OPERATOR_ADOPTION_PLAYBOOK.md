## Day 1: Foundation Verification

### Morning (30 minutes)

1. **Run setup validation:** Open Ted Workbench in OpenClaw, navigate to Setup card, click "Validate Setup"
   - Verify: Graph auth tokens valid for both Olumie and Everest
   - Verify: Scheduler is running (green indicator)
   - Verify: All config files loaded (hard_bans, autonomy_ladder, urgency_rules, etc.)

2. **Review Morning Brief:** Navigate to Reporting section, view today's morning brief
   - Check: Does it show real calendar events for today?
   - Check: Are commitments and actions listed?
   - Check: Does the email summary match what you see in Outlook?

3. **Verify entity separation:** Switch between Olumie and Everest profiles
   - Confirm: Different email, calendar, and deal data per entity
   - Confirm: No cross-entity data leakage

### Afternoon (30 minutes)

4. **Test deal pipeline:** Navigate to Deal Pipeline card
   - Verify: All 16 deals loaded with correct stages
   - Pick one deal: click into detail, verify brief was auto-generated
   - Check: Do contacts, key dates, and stage match reality?

5. **Test draft queue:** Navigate to Draft Queue card
   - Generate a test draft (morning brief or meeting prep)
   - Review the draft — does it match Clint's voice? (See Voice Calibration below)
   - Submit for review, then approve or archive

## Day 7: Calibration

### Voice Calibration (45 minutes, one-time)

1. **Collect 20-30 sent emails** from Outlook across these categories:
   - 5-8 to deal counterparties (brokers, sellers, counsel)
   - 5-8 to internal team (Isaac, Maurice)
   - 3-5 to investors or LPs
   - 3-5 casual/quick emails
   - 3-5 formal/longer emails

2. **Forward to Matt** for voice extraction into `draft_style.json`

3. **After voice update:** Generate 3-5 test drafts in different contexts
   - Compare to your actual sent emails
   - Note any persistent mismatches (too formal, wrong greeting, etc.)
   - Report corrections to Matt for config refinement

### Pipeline Accuracy (30 minutes)

4. **Review all 16 deals** for accuracy:
   - Are stages correct?
   - Are key contacts listed?
   - Are key dates current?
   - Flag any deals where Ted's view doesn't match reality

5. **Check stale owners:** Navigate to Deal Pipeline, click "Check Stale Owners"
   - Review any flagged deals
   - Is the 7-day threshold right, or should it be different?

6. **Review commitment extraction accuracy:**
   - Have Ted extract commitments from 3-5 recent emails
   - Check: are the extracted commitments real? Any false positives?

## Day 30: Assessment

### Trust Metrics Review (30 minutes)

1. **Navigate to Trust Dashboard:**
   - Check draft approval rate — target: >70% approved without major edits
   - Check triage classification accuracy — target: >80% correct
   - Check commitment extraction hit rate — target: >60% useful

2. **Review improvement proposals:**
   - How many proposals has Codex Builder generated?
   - Are any actionable? Approve or reject each one.

3. **Self-assessment questions:**
   - Am I spending less time on email triage than before Ted?
   - Are morning briefs useful, or do I skip them?
   - Is the draft queue saving me time, or am I rewriting everything?
   - Am I using Ted for deal pipeline tracking, or still using my old system?

### Decision Points

- If draft approval rate < 50%: voice needs more calibration (provide more samples)
- If morning briefs aren't useful: brief_config.json may need tuning
- If you're not using the deal pipeline: intake format may need simplification
- If improvement proposals are all noise: threshold/trigger tuning needed

---

## Ongoing: What to Expect

### Daily

- Morning brief (auto-generated if scheduler is enabled)
- EOD digest (auto-generated)
- Inbox ingestion (runs every 5 minutes during business hours)
- Draft queue items to review/approve

### Weekly

- Review stale owners (deals with no activity > 7 days)
- Clear improvement proposal backlog (>14 days = stale)
- Glance at trust metrics for trend

### Monthly

- Reconciliation run (Planner + To Do sync check)
- Review overall time savings
- Discuss with Matt: any new capabilities needed?

---

## Red Flags — When to Escalate to Matt

- Ted stops generating morning briefs → scheduler may have crashed (check systemd status)
- Graph auth errors appearing → token refresh may need manual intervention
- Cross-entity data appearing in wrong profile → entity firewall issue (STOP using Ted, escalate immediately)
- PHI appearing in draft queue → HIPAA hard gate may need review
- Consistent low trust scores → output contracts may need updating
