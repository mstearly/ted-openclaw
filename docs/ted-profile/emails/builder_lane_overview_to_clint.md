Clint,

Quick update on something the council designed this week. No decisions needed from you — just want you to understand how it works because it's one of the most important parts of the system.

**The short version:** Every time you correct Ted — edit a draft, reclassify an email, fix a commitment — Ted learns from it. Over time, he makes fewer of those mistakes.

**How it actually works:**

1. **You use Ted normally.** Morning briefs, draft queue, triage, deal tracking — everything you'd already be doing.

2. **When you correct something, Ted records the delta.** If he drafts an email closing with "Best regards" and you change it to "— Clint", he stores that correction. If he classifies an email as low-priority and you bump it to urgent, he stores that too. You don't click any extra buttons. Your natural corrections ARE the training signal.

3. **Ted detects patterns.** After enough similar corrections (typically 10-25 in the same category), Ted notices the pattern. Example: "Clint has changed the closing on 12 of the last 15 external drafts from formal to '— Clint'."

4. **Ted proposes a change.** He surfaces it in your morning brief or the Improvement Proposals card: "Based on 12 draft corrections, I'd like to change my default closing for external emails from 'Best regards' to '— Clint'. Here's what it looks like before and after." He shows you the evidence.

5. **You approve or dismiss.** One click. If you approve, Ted updates his configuration and starts drafting differently. If you dismiss, he won't propose the same change again for 30 days.

6. **If it's wrong, one-click undo.** Every change Ted makes to his own configuration is snapshotted. If an approved change makes things worse, you hit "Undo" and he reverts instantly.

**What Ted can and cannot change about himself:**

He CAN tune:

- Draft voice and style (closings, greetings, tone, word choices)
- Email triage urgency thresholds
- Morning brief structure
- Communication style rules

He can NEVER touch:

- His governance rules (hard bans, permission levels)
- Your identity/profile settings
- Microsoft 365 authentication
- Any code — he only adjusts configuration files

**About your writing voice:** Ted learns your voice automatically during onboarding. He reads your sent emails through Outlook (the same access you'll authorize for email triage) and extracts your writing patterns — sentence length, formality level, how you structure action items, how you open and close emails to different audiences. You don't need to provide anything manually. It happens in the background while Ted is already useful for briefs, triage, and deal tracking.

**The timeline:**

- **Weeks 1-2:** Ted observes silently. You'll see "Builder Lane: Collecting corrections" in the dashboard.
- **Weeks 3-6:** Ted starts noting patterns in your morning brief: "I noticed you tend to shorten my investor emails by about 40%."
- **Weeks 6-12:** First real proposals appear with evidence and before/after previews.
- **Months 3-6:** Ted's configuration is tuned to your world. Corrections decrease. He proposes changes less often because he's getting it right.

The key insight: every AI assistant that asked users to fill out preference surveys or rate outputs is dead. The ones that survived (Gmail's Smart Compose, Copilot's code suggestions) learn invisibly from what users actually do. Ted does the same thing — your workflow IS the training data.

No action needed. Just wanted you to know this is coming.
