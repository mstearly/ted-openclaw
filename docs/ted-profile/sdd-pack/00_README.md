# OpenClaw Ted Profile — Spec-Driven Development Pack

**Generated:** 2026-02-17  
**Purpose:** Provide a _project-ingestable_ spec pack to build a Mac-first OpenClaw fork ("Ted Profile") with a draft-only, auditable Microsoft Graph workflow and governed add-ons.

---

## How to Use This Pack

1. **Read `01_CONTEXT_PRIMER.md` first**  
   It captures the stable job-to-be-done, non‑negotiables, and day‑1 definition of done.

2. **Treat everything else as implementation guidance**  
   Many technical details in the source emails/docs are _user narrative_ and can evolve. This pack intentionally focuses on the _job_ and the _safety boundaries_.

3. **Implement as Epics + Job Cards**
   - Use `10_ROADMAP_JOB_BOARD.md` as the backlog spine.
   - Every job card includes _Proof_ steps (deterministic commands/tests) and a _Definition of Done_.

---

## What This Pack Produces

- A **clear baseline decision**: OpenClaw is the platform baseline; Ted Engine is a localhost sidecar.
- A **Mac installer specification** (auto-start, upgrades, rollback).
- A **security/governance spec** (Keychain-first, deny-by-default, approvals, audit).
- A **Graph draft-only spec** (two tenant profiles, least privilege).
- A **tooling spec** for OpenClaw → Ted Engine calls over loopback.

## Design Principles (Non-negotiable)

- **Draft-only by default**: never send emails or meeting invites without explicit human action.
- **Single-operator**: only the configured operator can use the system.
- **Keychain-first secrets**: no secrets or refresh tokens in plaintext files.
- **Fail-closed**: if auth/audit/policy/secret resolution fails, stop execution.
- **Full auditability**: log what happened and why (redacted).
