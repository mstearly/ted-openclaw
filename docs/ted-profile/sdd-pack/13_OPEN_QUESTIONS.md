# Open Questions (Answer When Convenient)

**Generated:** 2026-02-17

These are intentionally _few_ and only where choices matter.

1. **Distribution model**
   - Do we ship as one bundled installer (preferred), or two coordinated apps day‑1?

2. **Required day‑1 channels**
   - Telegram and/or iMessage? (iMessage is operationally fragile; Telegram is more predictable.)

3. **Graph scope minimum**
   - Do we need calendar tentative holds day‑1, or can we ship email drafts first and add holds in week 2?

4. **Filing actions day‑1**
   - Are “label/category only” actions sufficient, or do we need “move message to folder” in Phase 1?

5. **Retention**
   - How long should we retain audit/artifact logs locally? (Default suggestion: 90 days locally + operator export if needed.)
