## ADR-0003 — Microsoft Graph Auth Model + Scopes (JC-003)

**Status:** SUPERSEDED by ADR-0004
**Date:** 2026-02-18  
**Scope:** Ted Engine Graph integration (two profiles) + draft-only workflows

### Decision

1. **Auth model:** Delegated auth via **device-code** per profile (`profile_id`, `tenant_id`, `client_id`).
2. **Profiles:** Two explicit profiles are always supported; selection is **explicit per operation** (no hidden context switching).
3. **Token storage:** **No plaintext tokens** on disk. Token/refresh material must be stored via the approved secrets store (OS keychain-backed).
4. **Least-privilege scopes:** Start with only what is required for Day-1 draft workflows, and add scopes only when a concrete workflow demands it.
5. **Draft-only boundary:** Graph writes are restricted to **draft creation** (email drafts; optional tentative calendar item only when enabled). No send.
6. **Revoke behavior:** “Revoke” must:
   - delete local cached auth material for the selected profile (keychain-backed cache),
   - mark profile state as disconnected in status/doctor,
   - require re-auth (device-code) on next use.  
     Tenant-wide consent removal and grant revocation remain an admin action (documented as operator guidance).

### Minimum Scopes (Day-1)

- `User.Read`
- `Mail.Read` (optional; keep if draft creation uses read context)
- `Mail.ReadWrite` (required for draft creation)
- `Calendars.Read` (read-only brief/conflict detection)

**Optional (only when explicitly enabled by workflow):**

- `Calendars.ReadWrite` (tentative holds / calendar item creation)
- Task scopes (To Do / Planner) — only when task sync is enabled

### Rationale

- Delegated device-code avoids client secrets and supports fast setup for a single operator.
- Keychain-backed token caching prevents “credentials in files” risks.
- Least-privilege + “add only when needed” prevents scope creep and keeps the system governable.
- Explicit multi-profile routing avoids implicit context bleed across identities.

### Consequences

- Some tenants may block user consent → admin approval required (non-engineering blocker).
- Token expiry or policy changes require device-code re-auth.
- Calendar write features remain off until scopes + policy + gates are explicitly enabled and proven.

### Acceptance Criteria (SDD Gate)

- Two profiles configured and independently healthy
- Draft created in Outlook Drafts (never sent)
- No plaintext token/refresh-token artifacts
- Revoke clears local auth material and forces re-auth on next use
- Doctor reports Graph connectivity per profile (healthy/degraded) with clear fix steps

## ADR-0004 — Microsoft Graph auth model + minimum scopes (Draft-only, two profiles)

**Status:** Accepted  
**Applies to:** JC-003 (Draft-only Microsoft Graph, two profiles)  
**Canonical spec:** docs/ted-profile/sdd-pack/07_M365_GRAPH_SPEC.md

### Context

We need Microsoft Graph integration that supports two distinct profiles (`profile_id`, `tenant_id`, `client_id`) while enforcing:

- Draft-only email behavior (never send)
- Calendar read for briefing/conflict detection (no auto-invite sending)
- No plaintext token storage
- Fail-closed on missing consent/scopes/expired tokens, with reauth via device-code flow

### Decision

1. **Auth model:** Delegated user auth **only** (Device Code flow).
2. **Profile model:** Two explicit profiles; no inferred context switching.
3. **Minimum scopes (Phase 1 / auth + connectivity):**
   - `User.Read`
   - `offline_access`
   - (mail/calendar scopes introduced in later increment once auth is stable)
4. **Draft-only boundary enforcement (defense in depth):**
   - Never request `Mail.Send`
   - Draft creation is a later increment; must remain draft-only by scope + code
5. **Token/secret storage:**
   - No plaintext storage.
   - Use macOS Keychain when available; memory-only fallback is allowed (status must show `auth_store`).
6. **Revoke behavior:**
   - Local revoke deletes stored tokens for the profile_id and forces reauth.

### Consequences

- Completing Graph features (draft creation, calendar holds) are separate increments with explicit scope additions and new proofs.
