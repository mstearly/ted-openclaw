## User story

As **Operator (Clint)**, I want to **extract negotiated clauses from executed docs, rate/tag them, and reuse them in future drafts** so that **my drafting improves over time and institutional knowledge accumulates safely.**

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Ted can extract candidate clauses with section type and source document references.
- [ ] I can rate/tag clauses and search/filter them later.
- [ ] Ted can recommend clauses for a new draft based on prior usage/ratings.

## Notes / constraints

- Client wants to standardize clauses and reuse best-of language.

## Explicit non-goals (safety / scope)

- No autonomous outbound send (email, invites, third-party messaging).
- No access to personal email/calendar unless explicitly re-scoped by governance.
- No trading/broker execution.
