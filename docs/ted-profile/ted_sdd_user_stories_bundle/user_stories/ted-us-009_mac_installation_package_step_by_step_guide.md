## User story

As **Operator (Clint)**, I want to **install Ted/OpenClaw from a versioned package with a clear Mac guide (requirements, dependencies, configuration)** so that **I can reliably install/upgrade without a developer setup.**

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Provide a versioned installer artifact (or repo-based install path) and identify the 'latest stable' version.
- [ ] Guide includes system requirements, dependencies, and first-run configuration steps.
- [ ] Guide includes 'first successful run' checklist (wizard, doctor, daily outputs).

## Notes / constraints

- Client asked for an installation package + documentation and a step-by-step Mac guide.

## Explicit non-goals (safety / scope)

- No autonomous outbound send (email, invites, third-party messaging).
- No access to personal email/calendar unless explicitly re-scoped by governance.
- No trading/broker execution.
