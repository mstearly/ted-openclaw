## User story

As **Operator (Clint)**, I want to **measure whether Ted is improving (draft acceptance, triage volume, approval latency) and decide what to build next** so that **iteration is grounded in evidence, not guesswork.**

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Weekly scorecard reports: linkage coverage %, triage rate, draft acceptance rate, blocked job time/approval latency.
- [ ] Scorecard recommends the top 3 frictions to convert into job cards.
- [ ] Promotion to higher autonomy modes (if any) requires explicit safety criteria to be met.

## Notes / constraints

- Aligns to self-improvement loop scorecard and guardrails.

## Explicit non-goals (safety / scope)

- No autonomous outbound send (email, invites, third-party messaging).
- No access to personal email/calendar unless explicitly re-scoped by governance.
- No trading/broker execution.
