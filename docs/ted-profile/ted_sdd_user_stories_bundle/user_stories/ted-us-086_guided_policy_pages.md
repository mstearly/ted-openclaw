# TED-US-086 Guided Policy Pages

As Clint, I want policy documents to open as guided configuration pages so I can safely change policy without editing raw markdown.

Acceptance:

- Given I open Job Board/Promotion/Value-Friction policies, when page loads, then I see structured editable controls and plain-English descriptions.
- Given I make a policy change, when I request preview, then Ted shows impact summary before save.
- Given I save policy changes, then governance timeline records action and rationale.
