## User story

As **Operator (Clint)**, I want to **maintain a canonical task list and generate a daily to-do list** so that **I have a consistent commitments system that aligns with deal work.**

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] I can create/update tasks with due dates and deal linkage.
- [ ] Daily digest surfaces the top tasks and upcoming deadlines.
- [ ] Tasks remain local unless I explicitly enable external sync.

## Notes / constraints

- Client requested daily schedule + todo list as a top day-1 output.

## Explicit non-goals (safety / scope)

- No autonomous outbound send (email, invites, third-party messaging).
- No access to personal email/calendar unless explicitly re-scoped by governance.
- No trading/broker execution.
