## User story

As **Operator (Clint)**, I want to **create and maintain a deal ledger (deal_id, phase, entity, key dates, contacts)** so that **Ted can link emails/docs/tasks to deals and produce accurate status reporting.**

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] I can create a new deal record quickly with required fields and optional metadata.
- [ ] I can list/filter deals by status, phase, and entity/profile.
- [ ] Updates are logged and visible in audit; no silent edits.

## Notes / constraints

- Foundation for deal filing, deadlines, and dataroom organization.

## Explicit non-goals (safety / scope)

- No autonomous outbound send (email, invites, third-party messaging).
- No access to personal email/calendar unless explicitly re-scoped by governance.
- No trading/broker execution.
