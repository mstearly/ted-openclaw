# TED-US-097 Approval Ledger Correlation View

As Clint, I want an approval ledger that ties each decision to affected work items and confidence so I can approve faster with less ambiguity.

Acceptance:

- Given recommendation outcomes exist, when Ted loads, then a decision-impact ledger shows decision state, reason code, linked cards, and next safe step.
- Given a ledger entry has linked cards, when viewed, then Ted shows current promotion confidence signals for those cards.
- Given I need to act, when I select a linked card, then Ted opens that card detail for remediation.
