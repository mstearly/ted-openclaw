# TED-US-087 Structured Job Card Editor

As Clint, I want a structured job-card editor so I can update outcomes, dependencies, KPIs, and proof requirements without markdown expertise.

Acceptance:

- Given I open a job card, when editor opens, then structured fields are available with tooltips.
- Given I edit risky fields, when I attempt save, then preview is required.
- Given preview warns of missing proof/KPI, then save is blocked unless I explicitly acknowledge risk.
