# TED-US-095 Operator Flow and Approval Path Clarity

As Clint, I want a clear approval-path map in Ted so I know where to review drafts, approve actions, and use fallback safely.

Acceptance:

- Given Ted workbench is open, when I view run-today controls, then primary and fallback approval surfaces are explicitly shown.
- Given workflow notes are displayed, when I act, then path expectations match system behavior.
