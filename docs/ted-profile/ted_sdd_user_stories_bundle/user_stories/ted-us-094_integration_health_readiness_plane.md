# TED-US-094 Integration Health and Readiness Plane

As Clint, I want integration health shown inside Ted so I can resolve connector issues before they block work.

Acceptance:

- Given Ted workbench loads, when M365 profiles are checked, then each profile shows status, scope count, and next step.
- Given a profile is unhealthy, when viewed, then plain-language remediation is visible.
