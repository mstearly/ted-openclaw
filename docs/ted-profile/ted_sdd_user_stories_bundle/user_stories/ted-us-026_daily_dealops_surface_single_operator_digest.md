## User story

As **Operator (Clint)**, I want to **view a single daily surface combining drafts, filing suggestions, deadlines, tasks, and triage** so that **I have one place to run my day without chasing multiple tools.**

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Daily surface includes: draft queue, filing suggestions pending approval, deadlines/next actions, top tasks, triage/unfiled work.
- [ ] Surface can be generated on demand and/or on a daily schedule.
- [ ] Surface is an artifact (draft output) and is auditable.

## Notes / constraints

- Matches DealOps Daily Operator approach.

## Explicit non-goals (safety / scope)

- No autonomous outbound send (email, invites, third-party messaging).
- No access to personal email/calendar unless explicitly re-scoped by governance.
- No trading/broker execution.
