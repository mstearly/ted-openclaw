## User story

As **Operator (Clint)**, I want to **receive a daily schedule digest that highlights conflicts, priorities, and focus blocks** so that **I can plan my day without manually scanning the calendar.**

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Digest reads calendar events for the business profiles and summarizes the day.
- [ ] Highlights: conflicts, meetings lacking agendas/follow-ups, and suggested focus blocks.
- [ ] Digest does not modify the calendar.

## Notes / constraints

- Client wants daily schedule and scheduling efficiency.

## Explicit non-goals (safety / scope)

- No autonomous outbound send (email, invites, third-party messaging).
- No access to personal email/calendar unless explicitly re-scoped by governance.
- No trading/broker execution.
