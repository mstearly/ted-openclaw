# TED-US-092 Per-card Promotion Confidence

As Clint, I want each job card to show a promotion-confidence score with clear drivers so I can prioritize the right fixes before promotion.

Acceptance:

- Given job cards are loaded, when workbench renders, then every card shows a bounded confidence score and band.
- Given card detail is opened, when confidence is present, then Ted shows plain-English drivers and recommendation outcome impact.
