# TED-US-090 Guided Intake Wizard

As Clint, I want a guided intake wizard so I can define new work in plain language and receive safe defaults.

Acceptance:

- Given I start intake, when I progress through wizard, then each step explains what input is needed and why.
- Given wizard completes, when AI recommends setup, then suggested KPI pack, hard bans, and proof script template are provided.
