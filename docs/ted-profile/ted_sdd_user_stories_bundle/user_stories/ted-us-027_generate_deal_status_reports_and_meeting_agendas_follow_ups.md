## User story

As **Operator (Clint)**, I want to **generate status reports, checklists, agendas, and follow-up drafts from deal materials** so that **I can run deals consistently and reduce missed commitments.**

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] From emails/docs/tasks, system produces structured outputs (status report, checklist, agenda, follow-ups).
- [ ] Outputs include source references and clearly separate facts vs assumptions.
- [ ] Outputs are drafts/artifacts only and are not sent automatically.

## Notes / constraints

- Core job-to-be-done described by client.

## Explicit non-goals (safety / scope)

- No autonomous outbound send (email, invites, third-party messaging).
- No access to personal email/calendar unless explicitly re-scoped by governance.
- No trading/broker execution.
