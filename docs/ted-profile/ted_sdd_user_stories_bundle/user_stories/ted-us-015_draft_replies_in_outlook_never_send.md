## User story

As **Operator (Clint)**, I want to **generate ready-to-review email drafts in Outlook for replies and outbound emails** so that **I can move faster while keeping final human review before sending.**

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Given an email thread and instructions, Ted creates a draft reply in Outlook.
- [ ] Draft content is professional and includes suggested next steps and key points.
- [ ] Draft is linked to a deal/task (or goes to triage) and is recorded in a local draft queue.
- [ ] Ted never sends the email.

## Notes / constraints

- Draft-only boundary required.

## Explicit non-goals (safety / scope)

- No autonomous outbound send (email, invites, third-party messaging).
- No access to personal email/calendar unless explicitly re-scoped by governance.
- No trading/broker execution.
