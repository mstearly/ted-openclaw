## User story

As **Operator (Clint)**, I want to **track my investment theses, rules, and review points over time** so that **I can learn from outcomes and keep a consistent research process.**

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] I can record a thesis/rule note linked to a holding or watchlist entity.
- [ ] Ted can create reminders/tasks for review points (e.g., earnings, option expiry) subject to approval if syncing externally.
- [ ] No execution actions are ever performed.

## Notes / constraints

- Keeps this in a research lane.

## Explicit non-goals (safety / scope)

- No autonomous outbound send (email, invites, third-party messaging).
- No access to personal email/calendar unless explicitly re-scoped by governance.
- No trading/broker execution.
