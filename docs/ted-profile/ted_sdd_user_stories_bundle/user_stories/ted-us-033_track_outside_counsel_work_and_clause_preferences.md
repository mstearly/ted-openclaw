## User story

As **Operator (Clint)**, I want to **track what outside counsel produces and capture reusable preferences/performance notes** so that **I can standardize future deals and select counsel more effectively.**

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] I can associate deliverables and communications to a counsel profile.
- [ ] Ted can summarize counsel deliverables and turnaround times based on evidence.
- [ ] Outputs are internal artifacts only and include source references.

## Notes / constraints

- Client: track outside counsel’s work to standardize clauses and choose counsel.

## Explicit non-goals (safety / scope)

- No autonomous outbound send (email, invites, third-party messaging).
- No access to personal email/calendar unless explicitly re-scoped by governance.
- No trading/broker execution.
