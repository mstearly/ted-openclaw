## User story

As **Operator (Clint)**, I want to **have a deal-specific email organization scheme (folders/tags) that Ted can use for filing** so that **deal communications are discoverable and stay consistent across deals.**

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] When a deal is created, system can propose an email folder/tag structure for that deal.
- [ ] Structure can be approved and then used for future filing suggestions.
- [ ] Structure is editable via self-serve rules/config (no code change).

## Notes / constraints

- Client described 'deal specific emails that are used to tag all emails related to that deal'.

## Explicit non-goals (safety / scope)

- No autonomous outbound send (email, invites, third-party messaging).
- No access to personal email/calendar unless explicitly re-scoped by governance.
- No trading/broker execution.
