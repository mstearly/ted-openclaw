# TED-US-088 Unlock Simulator

As Clint, I want to see exactly what feature unlocks when thresholds change so I can trade speed and risk consciously.

Acceptance:

- Given I change thresholds, when simulator recalculates, then unlocked capabilities and increased risk are shown.
- Given risk increases beyond safe policy, when I apply, then warning and acknowledgment are required.
