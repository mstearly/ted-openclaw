# TED-US-093 Policy Change Impact Attribution

As Clint, I want policy updates to show impacted work areas and expected KPI movement so I can tune policy faster without guessing.

Acceptance:

- Given a policy save, when it succeeds, then Ted records impact attribution with changed fields, risk direction, linked cards, and expected KPI effects.
- Given workbench refresh, when policy impacts exist, then Ted shows recent impact entries and totals by policy page.
