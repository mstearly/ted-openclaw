# TED-US-089 KPI Cockpit

As Clint, I want KPI visibility at both job-card and portfolio level so I can see what is improving and what is drifting.

Acceptance:

- Given job cards exist, when I open KPI cockpit, then each card shows KPI state and trend.
- Given portfolio view, when loaded, then readiness by family is visible with pass/fail gates.
