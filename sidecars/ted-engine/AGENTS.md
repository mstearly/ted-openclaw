# Ted Engine (Sidecar HTTP Server) — AGENTS.md

## What this is (facts)

Ted Engine is a loopback-only HTTP server.

- Host and port are fixed to `127.0.0.1:48080` (`sidecars/ted-engine/server.mjs:16`, `sidecars/ted-engine/server.mjs:17`).
- Server entrypoint is `sidecars/ted-engine/server.mjs` (`sidecars/ted-engine/server.mjs:1`).

## Non-negotiables

- Must remain loopback-bound (`sidecars/ted-engine/server.mjs:1564`).
- `/status` and `/doctor` must remain stable and safe.
- `/status` and `/doctor` currently share one handler and one payload shape (`sidecars/ted-engine/server.mjs:1471`).
