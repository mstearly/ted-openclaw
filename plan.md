## Promotion model (required)

Every slice runs through recursive SDD phases:

1. spec/clarify update
2. task + job-card increment
3. deterministic proof script
4. gates + decision/risk updates
5. promotion decision (`SHADOW -> PREVIEW -> GA`)

## Current execution focus (dependency ordered)

1. Prove architecture seam (JC-001)
2. Lock Mac runtime (LaunchAgents + reboot survivability)
3. Enable Draft-only Graph (2 profiles) after seam is proven
4. Add ledgers (deal/triage/drafts/deadlines) behind governance
5. Execute `TED-US-048..061` in ordered slices:
   - Slice 1: role cards + hard bans + output contract
   - Slice 2: entity/provenance + cross-entity + audience redaction guards
   - Slice 3: escalation + contradiction + confidence policy
   - Slice 4: pause/resume + rate governance
   - Slice 5: deterministic learning + optional affinity routing
6. Enforce operator-loop coherence on every increment:
   - morning brief -> draft queue -> approve/escalate -> end-of-day digest
7. Enforce friction budget gates before promotion:
   - manual effort, approval queue age, unresolved triage, explainability completeness
8. Run council interrogation pass before each promotion decision:
   - workflow-vs-agent boundary
   - cognitive load and fast repair
   - orchestration retry/idempotency
   - eval/regression quality
   - security/policy abuse checks

All phases must pass gates defined in:
