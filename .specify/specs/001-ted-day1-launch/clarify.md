# Day-1 Clarifications (Council)

## A) P0 blockers (must decide before plan)

- ID: CLAR-P0-01 | Category: P0 | Owner(Role): Security/Governance | Question/Decision: Sidecar auth contract is enforced as `/auth/mint` bearer auth for all non-health routes; `/status` and `/doctor` remain loopback health endpoints. | Default recommendation: Keep this contract as release-blocking for Day-1. | Evidence needed: Auth contract tests (`401` without token on non-health, health reachable for doctor), loopback-only checks. | Status: DECIDED
- ID: CLAR-P0-02 | Category: P0 | Owner(Role): Platform Architect | Question/Decision: Day-1 deployables are exactly two runtimes: OpenClaw runtime and Ted sidecar runtime. | Default recommendation: Keep all bot/domain constructs as modules, not new services. | Evidence needed: Day-1 deployables allowlist + matrix alignment + overengineering gate CI pass. | Status: DECIDED
- ID: CLAR-P0-03 | Category: P0 | Owner(Role): Product/Outcome | Question/Decision: Is Telegram-only acceptable for Day-1 channel operations? | Default recommendation: If no explicit Clint decision, enforce Telegram-only and defer iMessage to Phase-2. | Evidence needed: Clint yes/no recorded in decision log. | Status: NEEDS_CLINT
- ID: CLAR-P0-04 | Category: P0 | Owner(Role): Product/Outcome | Question/Decision: Are Day-1 retention defaults approved (audit 30d, transient/media 7d, SDD snapshots 90d)? | Default recommendation: Use these defaults until Clint sets an override. | Evidence needed: Clint sign-off and retention config evidence in release gates. | Status: NEEDS_CLINT

## B) P1 clarifications (can decide during plan)

- ID: CLAR-P1-01 | Category: P1 | Owner(Role): Product/Outcome | Question/Decision: Whether tentative calendar holds are required in Phase-1 vs deferred after stable drafts. | Default recommendation: Drafts-first; calendar writes remain approval-gated and deferred unless explicitly required. | Evidence needed: Clint priority call + updated JC sequencing. | Status: OPEN
- ID: CLAR-P1-02 | Category: P1 | Owner(Role): Product/Outcome | Question/Decision: Filing Phase-1 execution depth (`label/category` only vs `move/apply`). | Default recommendation: Keep Day-1 suggestions + approval only; defer `apply/move` to later increment. | Evidence needed: Explicit destructive-op acceptance criteria and rollback strategy if promoted. | Status: OPEN
- ID: CLAR-P1-03 | Category: P1 | Owner(Role): Ops/Packaging | Question/Decision: Whether notarization/signing is required for first operator deployment. | Default recommendation: Internal-first unsigned allowed; notarization before broader distribution. | Evidence needed: Release channel policy and checklist update. | Status: OPEN

- ID: ASM-04 | Category: P0 | Owner(Role): Internal (Security/Governance) | Question/Decision: Tenant consent friction is handled by fail-closed behavior plus admin consent packet. | Default recommendation: Do not bypass consent failures; keep explicit remediation in doctor/setup. | Evidence needed: Consent checklist + doctor status mapping for consent failure. | Status: DECIDED

## E) Top 5 risks + mitigations
