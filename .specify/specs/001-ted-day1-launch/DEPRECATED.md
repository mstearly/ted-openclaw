# Deprecated or Redundant Stories

No story files are currently deprecated.

Guidance:

- Do not delete existing `TED-US-*` files.
- If overlap is discovered, record the redundant story ID here and point to the canonical replacement story ID.
- Keep historical context and rationale for each deprecation decision.
