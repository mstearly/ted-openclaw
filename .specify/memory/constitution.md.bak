# OpenClaw Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Channel and Extension Parity (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
Changes to shared routing, onboarding, command gating, allowlists, or pairing MUST
consider all built-in channels and relevant extensions. A feature is not complete until
cross-channel impact is documented and unsupported channels are explicitly justified.
Rationale: OpenClaw is multi-channel by design; partial rollouts create silent regressions.

### II. Typed and Maintainable TypeScript
All production changes MUST preserve strict TypeScript guarantees. New `any`,
`@ts-nocheck`, and prototype mutation-based behavior sharing are prohibited unless a
maintainer grants explicit exception approval. Favor explicit composition or inheritance
and concise files over duplicative "V2" forks. Rationale: type-safe, explicit structure is
required for long-term maintainability in a fast-moving CLI and gateway codebase.

### III. Verification First for Behavior Changes
Behavioral changes MUST include targeted tests or a documented reason tests are not
applicable. Before handoff, contributors MUST run relevant quality gates (`pnpm test`
or targeted tests, plus required lint/type/build checks for touched areas) and report
results. Rationale: feature velocity is only sustainable when regressions are caught
before release.

### IV. Operator Safe UX and Terminal Output
CLI and status output MUST stay script-safe and operator-friendly: preserve stable table
or machine-readable output expectations, use shared terminal primitives, and avoid
breaking automation unless versioned and documented. Rationale: OpenClaw is operated
in terminals and automation; output drift is a breaking interface.

### V. Documentation and Release Discipline
User-visible behavior changes MUST update docs and release notes in the same delivery
stream, using repository doc-linking rules and user-facing changelog language only.
Security, publish, and release flows MUST follow documented runbooks without ad-hoc
shortcuts. Rationale: reliable operations require docs and release artifacts to match the
running software.

## Engineering Constraints

- Runtime baseline MUST remain Node 22+ while preserving Bun and Node execution paths.
- Dependency changes MUST avoid patched dependency churn unless explicitly approved.
- Secrets, real credentials, and live personal data MUST never be committed.
- Plugin runtime dependencies MUST live in each plugin's `dependencies`; core-only deps
  MUST stay out of extension runtime manifests.

## Delivery Workflow and Quality Gates

1. Work starts from a clear spec with prioritized user stories and measurable outcomes.
2. Implementation plans MUST pass Constitution Check gates before major coding starts.
3. Tasks MUST be organized for independently testable story increments (MVP first).
4. For code changes, run the smallest sufficient validation set first, then full required
   checks before merge.
5. Pull requests MUST call out cross-channel impact, docs/changelog updates, and any
   justified constitution exceptions.

## Governance

This constitution overrides conflicting local conventions for feature planning, delivery,
and release quality. Amendments require a reviewed pull request that includes:
1. the proposed constitutional diff,
2. a migration impact note for active templates/processes, and
3. an explicit semantic version bump decision.

Constitution versioning policy:
- MAJOR: incompatible governance changes or principle removals/redefinitions.
- MINOR: new principles/sections or materially expanded obligations.
- PATCH: clarifications, wording, or non-semantic refinements.

Compliance review is required at plan time (Constitution Check), during implementation
(task structure and validation evidence), and in pull request review.
