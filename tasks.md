## Recursive execution rule

For each job card increment:

1. Confirm spec + clarify alignment
2. Execute proof script
3. Run gates
4. Record evidence in job card
5. Set promotion state (`SHADOW`, `PREVIEW`, `GA`, `DEFERRED`)
6. Confirm increment improves the canonical operator loop
7. Record friction-budget KPI evidence in the job card
8. Run council interrogation checklist and record findings/remediation

  - explainability missing count

## Mandatory Council Interrogation Evidence (each increment)

- Workflow vs agent boundary declaration
- Cognitive load impact statement + fast-repair path
- Orchestration retry/idempotency evidence
- Offline/production eval coverage and regression results
- Security/compliance abuse-path checks
